# Movix
## Discover your next favorite movie.

This is Movix, a React native application where you can quickly view all you need to know about a movie and mark it as liked, seen or disliked. 
Every movie you mark will be saved so you can go back to them later and view which ones you liked. 


I hope by building this application that some people will discover new movies they'll remember for years to come!


Here's a list of features that i want to be present in this app:
- [x] make it possible to create an account
- [x] change username
- [ ] change user password
- [x] view movies with their data from TMDB
- [x] filter on genre
- [x] mark movies
- [x] view marked movies per mark
- [x] view marked movie data 
- [x] change mark on marked movie
- [ ] stat page (percent per genre, global numbers, etc)
- [ ] make web portal for admin so he can add movies


Any feedback is more than appriciated! 


*All movie data comes from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)*


Below you'll find some pictures of my app!
